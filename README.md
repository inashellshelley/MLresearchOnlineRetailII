This paper presents a detailed analysis of the Online Retail II dataset using three prominent machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The dataset 
includes transactional records from a UKbased online retail store spanning two years. 
The data is multivariate, sequential, and timeseries in nature, posing challenges for 
analysis. The dataset contains information 
about retail transactions, including attributes 
such as Invoice, StockCode, Description, 
Quantity, Price, Customer ID, and Country. 
We preprocess the dataset, handle missing 
values, and encode categorical variables 
before training the models. The paper outlines 
the preprocessing techniques employed to 
handle missing data and categorical variables, 
followed by the training and evaluation of the 
classifiers. Performance metrics such as 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are 
computed to assess the classifiers' 
effectiveness in predicting transaction 
outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate 
the capabilities of the classifiers in accurately 
categorizing transactions, with potential 
applications in customer behavior analysis 
and business decision-making. Our 
experimental results indicate that Decision 
Tree outperforms Logistic Regression and 
KNN in accuracy. This study provides 
valuable insights into the application of 
machine learning techniques in the retail 
domain.
